   <p>
    Since the 1970s, meditation and other stress-reduction techniques have been studied as possible treatments for
    depression and anxiety. One such practice, yoga, has received less attention in the medical literature, though it has
    become increasingly popular in recent decades. One national survey estimated, for example, that about 7.5% of U.S.
    adults had tried yoga at least once, and that nearly 4% practiced yoga in the previous year. </p>

    Yoga classes can vary from gentle and accommodating to strenuous and challenging; the choice of style tends to be based
    on physical ability and personal preference. Hatha yoga, the most common type of yoga practiced in the United States,
    combines three elements: physical poses, called asanas; controlled breathing practiced in conjunction with asanas; and a
    short period of deep relaxation or meditation.
